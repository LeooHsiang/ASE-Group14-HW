# HW 4: Report 
## Topic
#### For our report, we decided to create our repgrids on different car brands and the attributes are high status car, expensive, good quality, eco friendly, and good design.
---
## Results and Analysis
#### After running the tool on 3 different users who have no communication with each other, we noticed many more similarities than differences. This was expected because we know that as a society, we have certain views on cars. For example, the users all rated high for eco friendly vs not eco friendly for tesla vs bugatti respectively. Furthermore, after looking at the built repgrids the eco friendly attribute is on its own branch, showing that it is not closely connected with other attributes.

#### Looking at how the attributes are connected, we noticed that expensive and good quality are closely related as they are on the same leaf nodes. This also applied with technically advanced and good design. We also noted that high status and eco friendly are not closely connected with the other attributes.
